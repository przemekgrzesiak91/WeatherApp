# WeatherApp
In this project, I wanted to test my skills in Django and web scraping.

## Description
A weather comparison site is a place where you can compare some of the weather conditions between 3 polish weather sites.
In one place you can see temperature, sky, wind, and atmospheric pressure.
Warszawa is a default city but there is an option to search for another city.
